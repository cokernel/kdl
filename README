This Blacklight app is a demo of a site [1] intended to showcase
Bill Endres's Manuscripts of Lichfield Cathedral Project [2],
making available online two important illuminated manuscripts
held by the Lichfield Cathedral [3].

Michael Slone and Eric Weig have contributed to the 
Blacklight side of things.

We are currently using Blacklight 2.7.
